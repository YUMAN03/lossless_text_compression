## PROJECT NAME AND BRIEF SUMMARY : lossless image compression algorithm using Huffman coding.

The aim of image compression is to remove unwanted information from image so that it can be able to transmit or store data in an efficient form. Compression basically means removing unwanted information from image which only lead to the enhancement of memory space requirement without affecting quality of image.
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. Using this algorithm we can assign variable-length bit codes to the data that is being compressed. The characters are assigned codes based on their frequency of occurrence and the characters with the highest frequency are assigned smallest length bit codes and the characters with the least frequency are assigned the longest length bit codes. 

## How to run the code

 Open a terminal in the folder containing the project.
 Run `g++ compress_bmpimage.cpp` to compile the CPP file.
 To see the input image data ,Execute `/a.out` to run the CPP file.
 Run `readfile.cpp` to compile the CPP file.
 To see the output image data ,Execute `/a.out` to run the CPP file.
